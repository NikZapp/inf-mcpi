# inf-mcpi
Backend code to use MCPI's python API to make infinite worlds with custom generation

Does not save player-placed blocks!

Generation is still slow, but it does work and can be changed

Documentation to make custom generation is inside the file.

Demo requires `perlin-noise` to be installed.
